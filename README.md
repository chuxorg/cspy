I'm using this repo to keep my chops up by putting together some computer science concepts using Python. Feel free to clone this repo.



- [Big O Notation][bigo]
   In the ```bigo``` folder there is a well-commented file named ```bigo.py```. This file contains examples of how Big O Notation is used to measure time complexity by using different constructs in algorithms that impact time and space complexity. What is O(1), O(n), O(n^2), and  O(log n)?
- [Classes][classes]
   Classes are an important concept in Python. In the ```classes``` folder there is an example of a Python Class.
   You can read more about [Classes][classes] in Python.
- [Pointers][pointers]
   Even though Python doesn't allow you to manage ```Pointers``` directly, the subject is still important to understand.
   In the ```pointers/``` directory you will see code examples that explain how ```Pointers``` work in Python.
   You can read more about [Pointers][pointers] in Python.
- [Linked Lists][linkedlists]
   A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object known as a node. In the ```linked_lists/```
   folder you will find an example with well documented code. You can read more about [Linked Lists][linkedlists] in Python.
